            <p>                
My current research involves the development of statistical and spatial models to analyse the spreading of vector-borne diseases and insecticide resistance, with special emphasis in the impact of climate change in these elements. Below are three key elements I'm interested in. I'm not currently running a wet lab, thus, my efforts are mainly focused on computational solutions using R, Python, QGIS, and more recently C#-F# (as this website).

        <h2>How I got into vector-borne diseases?</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                I have been devoted to the study of vector-borne diseases (vbd) for the last nine years. My first approach to this neglected area was in my Master's degree thesis. At the beginning, my initial objective was determining the host preference of Aedes aegypti in Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, México. However, I decided to spice things up and included viral detection in mosquito samples (DENV, CHIKV, and WNV) as well as the formulation of a mathematical model based in Markov Chains to estimate the transmission potential of those pathogens in my city. I got quickly captivated by vbd and everything that I learned in this period. I combined different techniques encompassing molecular biology methods, field work, and what is my current area of work, statistical and mathematical modelling.

                Given this fascination, I went for a PhD in Medical and Veterinary Entomology. There, I delved into the analysis of insecticide resistance (IR). I had an incredibly good opportunity to gain theoretical and practical experience in testing phenotypic IR, exploring IR mechanisms, working with different disease vectors such as mosquitoes, ticks, lice, among others. It is worth to mention that during my doctoral studies I developed (and I still am developing) writing skills. My doctoral thesis proposed a specific link between IR and vector competence (VC) for DENV-2 in Ae. aegypti, resulting in a positive relationship, that is, IR promotes VC for this arbovirus. Alongside my thesis, I participated in other projects (see publications) ranging from testing acaricides to creating spatial models of IR spread. The latter is one of my main research interests.

                Not so long ago (two years) I started working as a researcher in Avia-GIS. Within this company I have the chance to apply techniques for studying arboviral transmission at different scales. I have participated in projects aiming to detect hotspots of dengue transmission in a time-effective way to improve vector management. Besides, I spent much of my time investigating how climate (and pretty much climate change) relates to disease transmission, again, to increase our preparedness against epidemics. One of the nicest projects I participated in was aimed to know the current distribution of five arboviral diseases around the world using machine learning methods. Statistical and Spatial analyses are crucial and compulsory tools needed for my current position as can be interpreted from my previous lines. Spending eight years learning and applying multivariate analyses in combination with spatial analysis in R, python, and QGIS, in a self-thought manner was a real advantage.
